# Optimal District Finder

This project solves the problem of choosing the optimal district from the associative array of districts data. 
District can have different types of buildings like hospital, school, restaurant or gym.

The algorithm goes through the array twice (from left to right and from right to left) to calculate the minimum distance
from each district to the nearest buildings.
